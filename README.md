# Legacy Portfolio
A personal portfolio website intended to showcase information about me, skills, projects and a simple way to contact me!

Check out the live site [here](https://msichterman.github.io/)!

## Motivation
I originally created this site as one of my responsive web design projects in the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. I then adjusted the requirements to achieve my personal goals of creating a well-designed, memorable and easy-to-navigate portfolio to easily showcase me!
